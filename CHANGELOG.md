## [2026-04-05] Yelp discovery layer

### Added
- `spot.discover [type] [location]` — parallel Yelp discovery workflow (API business search + delivery eligibility + page verification, top-3 reviews fetched in parallel). Returns ranked shortlist with decision signals. Flows into `spot.venue.add` → `spot.check` → `spot.book`.
- Yelp storage: `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-spot/yelp/` (alias-cache, shortlists, request-log)
- `spot.init` step 4: optional Yelp API key setup with public page fallback
- `yelp_api_key` optional credential in skill.json
- `discovery` and `yelp` tags added

### Changed
- `description` updated to include discovery trigger phrases
- `filesystem.write` extended to include `yelp/` subdirectory

### Validation
- ✓ Version: 2.0.2 → 2.1.0

## [2026-04-04] Spec Compliance Update

### Changes
- Added missing SKILL.md sections per ocas-skill-authoring-rules.md
- Updated skill.json with required metadata fields
- Ensured all storage layouts and journal paths are properly declared
- Aligned ontology and background task declarations with spec-ocas-ontology.md

### Validation
- ✓ All required SKILL.md sections present
- ✓ All skill.json fields complete
- ✓ Storage layout properly declared
- ✓ Journal output paths configured
- ✓ Version: 2.0.1 → 2.0.2

# Changelog

## [2.2.1] - 2026-04-08

### Storage Architecture Update

- Replaced $OCAS_DATA_ROOT variable with platform-native {agent_root}/commons/ convention
- Replaced intake directory pattern with journal payload convention
- Added errors/ as universal storage root alongside journals/
- Inter-skill communication now flows through typed journal payload fields
- No invented environment variables — skills ask the agent for its root directory


## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-08

### Multi-Platform Compatibility Migration

- Adopted agentskills.io open standard for skill packaging
- Replaced skill.json with YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md
- Replaced hardcoded ~/openclaw/ paths with {agent_root}/commons/ for platform portability
- Abstracted cron/heartbeat registration to declarative metadata pattern
- Added metadata.hermes and metadata.openclaw extension points
- Compatible with both OpenClaw and Hermes Agent


## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Resy: switch from browser-only to REST API with token auth for auth-gated restaurants (e.g. Copra)
- Resy: add credential-based token flow (RESY_API_KEY, RESY_EMAIL, RESY_PASSWORD env vars)
- Resy: 12-hour token cache in `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-spot/resy-token.json` — portable across machines
- Resy: browser automation retained as fallback for unauthenticated venues; warns when credentials not set

### Changed
- `references/platforms/resy.md` — updated status to ⚠️ Working (auth-dependent), documented env vars, token flow, API endpoints
- SKILL.md platform table — Resy row updated to reflect auth requirement
- Version 2.0.0 → 2.0.1

- Version 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

### Removed
- `logs/` directory (debug artifacts — not a valid OCAS support directory)

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (session research document)
- `README.md` (not in OCAS build template)
- `scripts/__pycache__/` (committed bytecode)
- ~100 research-iteration scripts replaced by 5 clean platform implementations: `acuity.js`, `square.js`, `sevenrooms.py`, `resy.py`, `tock.py`
