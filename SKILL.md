# Spot

Spot automates appointment and reservation availability checks, bookings, and persistent monitoring across service venues. It maintains a registry of known venues, a watchlist for ongoing availability monitoring, and handles the full booking flow. This automation exists because manual booking monitoring is time-consuming and error-prone, especially across 20+ different platforms.

## When to Use

- Checking appointment or reservation availability at salons, spas, or restaurants
- Booking appointments or reservations at supported venues
- Monitoring venues for newly opened slots ("watch" use cases)
- Discovering and comparing new venues via Yelp before booking

## When NOT to Use

- General travel planning — use `ocas-voyage`
- Calendar sync or conflict checking — use `ocas-sands`
- Restaurant reservations on platforms Spot does not support
- Platforms requiring authentication Spot does not hold
- General web scraping unrelated to appointment booking

## Responsibility boundary

Spot owns: availability checks, appointment bookings, venue registry management, booking history, watchlist management, platform detection, and platform knowledge base maintenance.

Spot does not own: general travel planning (Voyage), calendar sync, restaurant reservations on unsupported platforms, or platforms requiring authentication Spot does not hold.

## Ontology types

- **Place** — venues where appointments or reservations are made. Included in journal signal payloads on first booking or first watch entry for a new venue.
- **Concept/Event** — confirmed appointments and reservations. Included in journal signal payloads after booking confirmation.

## Commands

### Discovery

`spot.discover [type] [location] [--open-now] [--price 1|2|3|4] [--min-rating N]` — find and compare venues using Yelp before adding one to the registry. Fans out in parallel: Yelp API business search, delivery eligibility check (where applicable), and public page verification. Fetches reviews for the top 3 candidates in parallel. Returns a ranked shortlist with decision signals. Flows into `spot.venue.add` → `spot.check` → `spot.book`.

After discovery, user selects from shortlist. Selected venue is auto-populated into `spot.venue.add` using the Yelp alias. If `YELP_API_KEY` is not set, Spot falls back to public Yelp page navigation — same output, slower, less structured.

### Availability and booking

`spot.check [venue] [service] [date_range]` — Check availability at a venue. `venue` may be a registered name or booking URL. `date_range` defaults to next 30 days. Returns available dates and time slots.

`spot.book [venue] [service] [datetime] [--name NAME] [--email EMAIL] [--phone PHONE]` — Book an appointment. Reads contact defaults from `config.json` if flags omitted. Writes BookingRecord to `bookings.jsonl`. Emits Place + Concept/Event Signals via journal payload and an InsightProposal to Vesper (via journal briefing payload). If the venue location matches an active Voyage itinerary destination (checked via `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-voyage/itineraries/`), appends a Travel Context entry to that itinerary record.

`spot.list [--upcoming] [--all]` — List bookings from `bookings.jsonl`. Default: next 30 days.

### Watchlist and monitoring

`spot.watch.add [venue] [party_size] [--dates DATE[,DATE]] [--range FROM TO] [--time HH:MM-HH:MM] [--priority high|normal]` — Add a venue to the watchlist. Writes a WatchRecord to `watch.jsonl`. `venue` may be a registered name or URL. If platform is unknown, runs `spot.platform.probe` automatically.

`spot.watch.list` — List all active WatchRecords from `watch.jsonl`.

`spot.watch.remove [watch_id]` — Mark a WatchRecord as inactive (sets `active: false`). Does not delete.

`spot.watch.sweep [--platform PLATFORM]` — Check all active WatchRecords for new availability. On new availability, writes an InsightProposal to Vesper and updates the record. Always updates `last_checked`.

### Venue management

`spot.venue.add [name] [url] [--service NAME:ID] [--staff ID]` — Register a venue. Runs platform detection, writes VenueRecord to `venues.jsonl`.

`spot.venue.list` — List all registered venues with platform, status, and last-checked date.

`spot.platform.probe [url]` — Detect booking platform type. Follows Universal Decision Tree in `references/platforms/README.md`. Returns platform type, confidence, and recommended approach.

### Platform-specific

`spot.opentable.login` — Open a visible browser window for manual OpenTable login. Saves session state to `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-spot/opentable-session.json`. Run once; re-run if checks start failing. See `references/platforms/opentable.md`.

### Maintenance

`spot.update` — Pull latest release from GitHub. Preserves `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-spot/` and journals. See `references/self-update.md` for the update procedure.

## NLP parsing

See `references/nlp-parsing.md` for the full parameter extraction table. Extract structured parameters from natural language before calling any command. When `time_window` is extracted, filter returned times to that window before presenting results. Resolve ambiguous date language ("next Saturday") against today's date before calling any script.

## Booking workflow

See `references/booking-workflow.md` for the full 7-step booking procedure.

## Platform support

Spot supports 20+ booking platforms across three architectural patterns:

| Pattern | Platforms | Auth |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **REST API** | Acuity Scheduling, Calendly | None / API token |
| **Public Widget API** | SevenRooms (availability) | None |
| **Browser Automation** | Square Appointments, Resy, Tock, OpenTable, Meevo, Vagaro, Mindbody, Fresha, StyleSeat, Booksy, GlossGenius, SimplyBook.me, Boulevard, Mangomint, DaySmart, Yelp Reservations, ResDiary, Eat App, SevenRooms (booking) | Session / none |

**Status key:** ✅ Production · ⚠️ Working (known limitations) · 🆕 New (untested) · ❌ Blocked (bot detection)

Full platform directory and decision tree: `references/platforms/README.md`
Bot block status and bypasses: `references/platform-access-matrix.md`
Key platform quirks: `references/platform-notes.md`

## Cron sweep pattern

See `references/cron-sweep-pattern.md` for the cron-specific sweep flow including browser lifecycle management.

## Watch sweep behavior

- [ ] Load all active WatchRecords from `watch.jsonl`.
- [ ] For each record, call the platform script with venue, dates/range, and party_size. For Square, use the stealth browser flow below.
- [ ] Filter results to the record's `time_window` if set.
- [ ] Compare found times against `last_found`. If new times exist, write an InsightProposal to Vesper (via journal briefing payload) and update `last_found` + `last_checked`.
- [ ] Always update `last_checked`, even when no availability found.
- [ ] Write an **Action** journal entry when availability changed (new or different times found). Write an **Observation** journal entry when no change detected.
- [ ] Journal format: flat JSON with `run_id`, `timestamp`, `type` (Action|Observation), `results[]` array containing one entry per venue checked, each with `watch_id`, `venue`, `platform`, `status`, and change details. See `references/journal-schema.md` for the canonical schema.

## Optional skill cooperation

- **Chronicle** — Spot emits Place and Concept/Event Signals to journal payload fields after confirmed bookings and on first watch-add for a new venue.
- **Vesper** — Spot writes InsightProposals to journal payload fields when watch-sweep finds new availability and after confirmed bookings.
- **Sands** — Before booking: conflict-check request to `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-sands/intake/{check_id}.conflict.json`. After booking: event creation request to `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-sands/intake/{event_id}.event.json`. External venue confirmation is authoritative — never roll back on Sands failure.
- **Voyage** — On confirmed booking, checks `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-voyage/itineraries/` for matching destinations. Appends Travel Context entry if matched.
- **ocas-vpn** — Called when bot detection blocks access. Provides non-US exit IPs. See `references/vpn-integration.md`.

## Journal outputs

Every `spot.check`, `spot.book`, `spot.watch.add`, and `spot.watch.sweep` run writes a journal to `{agent_root}/commons/journals/ocas-spot/YYYY-MM-DD/{run_id}.json`.

- **Observation Journal** — `spot.check`, `spot.watch.sweep` with no new availability
- **Action Journal** — `spot.book`, `spot.watch.sweep` when an InsightProposal is written

See `references/journal-schema.md` for the full journal JSON schema.

## Storage layout

See `references/storage-layout.md` for the full directory tree and record schemas (VenueRecord, BookingRecord, WatchRecord).

## Background tasks

During `spot.init`, cron registration for spot jobs is handled via `cronjob(action='create', ...)`. No heartbeat registry needed. See `references/self-update.md` for the cron registration pattern.

## OKRs

See `references/okrs.md` for all targets (journal coverage, sweep latency, platform coverage, booking accuracy, bot block recovery, onboarding time, schedule adherence).

## Recovery Behavior

When Spot encounters failures — bot blocks, VPN disconnects, platform timeouts, or data corruption — it follows these principles:

- [ ] **Idempotency** — All recovery actions are idempotent.
- [ ] **Graceful degradation** — If a platform is unreachable, log the failure, mark the record, and continue. Partial results are never discarded.
- [ ] **VPN reconnection** — If `tun0` drops mid-sweep, pause, reconnect via `ocas-vpn`, and resume from the last completed entry.
- [ ] **Data repair** — Quarantine corrupt JSONL lines to `.quarantine/` and reconstruct last valid state from journal outputs.
- [ ] **Audit continuity** — Every recovery action is recorded in `intents.jsonl` and `evidence.jsonl`.

## Initialization

`spot.init`:

1. Create data and journals directories if not present.
2. Write `config.json` with defaults: `{ "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles", "name": null, "email": null, "phone": null }`
3. Register cron and heartbeat (see Background Tasks above).
4. **Yelp setup** (optional, run once): `spot.discover` works without `YELP_API_KEY` (page mode). For API mode, create a free key at `https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app` and add to env config.

## VirtualPerson Integration

For bot-blocked platforms (Tock, OpenTable, Mindbody, Fresha), VirtualPerson provides a headed Chrome environment that's harder to detect than headless Chromium. Patched files for VPN Gate integration are at `references/virtualperson-patches/`. See `ocas-vpn` skill for VPN setup. Connect via CDP: `p.chromium.connect_over_cdp("http://127.0.0.1:9222")`.

## Gotchas

- **OpenTable requires Firefox** — Akamai blocks Chromium-based browsers for OpenTable. The skill must use Firefox for any OpenTable booking attempt.
- **Bot blocks require VPN fallback** — CF Turnstile, PerimeterX, and Incapsula blocks are common on Tock, Mindbody, Fresha, and Vagaro. The VPN fallback via `ocas-vpn` resolves ~80% of blocks; if VPN is unavailable, the booking will fail.
- **Square: use stealth browser, not Playwright or built-in browser** — Square Appointments automation uses the MCP stealth browser (`mcp_stealth_browser_*` tools). The built-in `browser_navigate` fails with `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` on Square pages. The full verified flow is in `references/stealth-browser-square-flow-20260608.md`. Key: `execute_script` works for `window.location.href` only — use `query_elements` + `click_element` for all DOM interaction.
- **Stealth browser instance may need re-spawn** — First `navigate` call on a fresh instance can fail with `[Errno 111] Connect call failed`. Re-spawn a new instance and retry. This is a race condition, not a persistent failure.
- **Square `disabled` attribute on dates** — The `disabled` attribute on `market-button[data-testid^='date-']` elements is the correct availability check. `query_elements` returns `attributes.disabled` — if present, the date is unavailable. For **past** dates this is expected. For **future** dates this means the booking window hasn't reached that date yet (venue only books ~1 week out) OR the date is fully booked. Preserve `last_found` and re-check in a few days.
- **Square calendar viewport behavior** — The date strip extends beyond the 1920px viewport (x positions range from negative for past dates to >1500 for future dates). No scrolling needed — all dates are in the DOM and queryable via `query_elements` even if partially off-screen. The calendar shows ~3 weeks at a time (past days as disabled, current week, future weeks up to the booking window — beyond which dates are also disabled). Use `data-testid^='date-'` to get all dates; check `disabled` attribute and `data-testid` value (N vs N-selected) to identify the target date.
- **Square time slot state** — `market-button[data-testid='time-slot']` elements render for all available slots. Unlike dates, time slots do NOT use the `disabled` attribute to indicate unavailability — if a slot is listed, it's bookable. If a date is clicked and no time-slot elements appear, the date has zero availability (outside window or fully booked).
- **Square OneTrust cookie banner** — Always check for and dismiss the cookie banner first step after navigation. Use `click_element(selector="#accept-recommended-btn-handler")` (CSS ID selector is faster than text_match). Without dismissing it, subsequent clicks may not register on overlapping elements.
- **Meevo and Vagaro are effectively unautomated** — Despite HTTP access working, both platforms have persistent automation failures (Meevo: Angular change detection, 50+ consecutive failures; Vagaro: JS handler failures, 60+ consecutive failures). Skip these in watch sweeps rather than wasting cycles. Re-attempt only if platform behavior changes.
- **External booking confirmation is authoritative** — If Sands reports a conflict after a successful venue booking, the external confirmation stands. Sands write failure never cancels an already-confirmed booking.
- **20+ platforms, each with unique selectors** — Each booking platform has its own edge cases documented in `references/platforms/<platform>.md`. Always read the per-platform doc before attempting a new platform.
- **SevenRooms public widget API** — Availability checks use the public widget API (no auth). Booking requires browser automation via Playwright on the customer widget page. There is no customer-facing REST API; `api.sevenrooms.com` is merchant-only.
- **Journal path is NOT profile-scoped** — Journals always go to `<hermes-home>/commons/journals/ocas-spot/YYYY-MM-DD/{run_id}.json`, NOT under `profiles/indigo/`. Writing journals to the profile-scoped path means other profiles and the Vesper aggregator won't find them.

## Platform notes

Spot uses `cronjob` for appointment monitoring. On platforms without `cronjob`, the user triggers checks manually. Yelp API calls and browser automation are platform-independent.
